## 📖 Manifesto

This is not a simple tool repository, but a **"Laplace's Demon"** fighting against information entropy.

Penetration testing is fundamentally an information game. However, we face:

- **High Entropy of Tools**: Scripts scattered across GitHub, complex configurations, and incompatibility.
- **High Entropy of Thinking**: Methodologies stuck in attackers' minds, lacking standardized Prompts and SOPs.
- **High Entropy of Knowledge**: Quality results drowned in fragmented articles and blogs.

This repository is dedicated to maintaining **"Negentropy"** in these three directions: collecting, cleaning, and structuring them.

## 🏗️ The Three Pillars

### 🗡️ Pillar I: Tools (Praxis)

Entropy reduction at the physical layer. We don't reinvent the wheel; we make it spin more precisely.

| Project                                                      | Description                                                  | Status   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| [**Entropy**](https://github.com/xgbtxy/Negentropy-Collective/tree/main/Tools/Entropy) | **Traffic Negentropy.** Burp plugin providing Workspace, Custom Shortcuts, and Passive Proxy Linkage. (Formerly *Burp-Negentropy-Extension*) | ✅ Stable |
| **Auto-Recon-Scripts**                                       | *Coming Soon...* Automated asset reconnaissance script collection. | 🚧 Dev    |

### 🧠 Pillar II: Methodology (Gnosis)

Entropy reduction at the logical layer. Translating human experience into machine-readable Prompts and SOPs.

| Framework               | Description                                                  | Type   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **AI-Security-Prompts** | **Prompt Engineering.** Standardized prompt library for SQLi/XSS analysis to eliminate AI hallucinations. | 📝 Text |
| **Entropy-SOP**         | **SOPs.** Standardized entropy-reduction workflows from recon to reporting. | 📜 Doc  |

### 🔗 Pillar III: Niche Arsenal (Knowledge)

Refusing Mediocrity. We do not collect mainstream tools (like SQLMap), but only **"Hidden Gems"** and **"Self-Developed Mods"** that solve specific pain points.

This is the "Special Operations" zone of the Negentropy system. We focus on collecting code snippets that significantly reduce entropy in specific stages but are rarely known.

#### 🧪 Self-Developed & Forked

Code born from "impromptu ideas" in actual combat, becoming the key to solving problems.

| Tool / Script                                                | Pain Point Solved                                            | Lang |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| [**Entropy**](https://github.com/xgbtxy/Negentropy-Collective/tree/main/Tools/Entropy) | Solves Burp batch interaction gaps, token waste during AI analysis, and allows keyboard-driven tagging. | Java |
| [**Example-Script**](https://www.google.com/search?q=./Scripts/Example) | Hard-coded decryption script for a specific OA system version. | Py   |

#### 💎 Hidden Gems

Open-source projects with low Star counts but miraculous effects in specific scenarios.

- **[Project-X]** - *(TBD)* Focuses on solving echo issues in a niche WebLogic version.
- **[Tool-Y]** - *(TBD)* Identifies "secondary development" fingerprints ignored by conventional scanners.

#### 📑 Deep Dive Resources

Only high-quality articles with "unique insights" or "reproducibility", rejecting fluff.

- **[Article-Z]** - *(TBD)* Practices on Prompt tuning for logic vulnerability mining.

## 🤝 Contribution

This repository needs constant energy input to maintain low entropy. If you discover:

1. A script that improves efficiency (**Tools**)
2. A clear mental model or Prompt (**Methodology**)
3. A niche tool that solves a specific pain point (**Niche Arsenal**)

Please submit a PR to join our Negentropy collection.

**Let's reduce the entropy of the cyber world.**
