## 📖 Manifesto

**This is not a repository for a single tool, but a collective for "Negentropy" implementations in penetration testing.**

In cybersecurity, our greatest adversary is **Chaos**—massive traffic, redundant logs, and complex attack surfaces. This repository is dedicated to building a complete **Entropy Reduction System**, transforming chaos into ordered intelligence.

This system is built upon two core pillars:

### 🛠️ Pillar I: Tools (Praxis)
> **The Tangible Implementations.**
> Code, plugins, and scripts. These are the physical means of entropy reduction, responsible for data cleaning, extraction, and transmission.

### 🧠 Pillar II: Methodology (Gnosis)
> **The Abstract Frameworks.**
> Mental models, AI Prompts, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These are the logical cores guiding the process, defining how raw data is transmuted into intelligence.

## 🗂️ Module Index

### 📂 [Tools](Tools/)
Engineering implementations for noise reduction at the physical layer.

#### 🔌 [Burp Suite Extension](Tools/Burp-Extension/README.md)
* **Type**: Java Plugin
* **Core Function**: Entropy reduction at the traffic level.
    * **Entropy Reduction Mode**: Intelligently truncates response bodies, preserving only Headers and key logic to provide high signal-to-noise context for AI.
    * **Flow Continuity**: Fixes interaction breakpoints in Burp's batch operations, enabling one-click batch repeating.

#### 🛠️ Scripts
* *Coming Soon...* (Python/Go auxiliary scripts in development)

---

### 📂 [Methodology](Methodology/)
Future frameworks for noise reduction at the logical layer.

#### 🤖 AI Prompts
* *Coming Soon...* (Standardized Prompt libraries for SQLi, XSS, and logic vulnerability analysis)

#### 📜 Workflows
* *Coming Soon...* (Standardized SOPs for entropy-reduced penetration testing)
