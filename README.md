## 📖 Manifesto

**This is not a simple tool repository, but a "Laplace's Demon" fighting against information entropy.**

Penetration testing is fundamentally an information game. However, we face:
1.  **High Entropy of Tools**: Scripts scattered across GitHub, complex configurations, and incompatibility.
2.  **High Entropy of Thinking**: Methodologies stuck in attackers' minds, lacking standardized Prompts and SOPs.
3.  **High Entropy of Knowledge**: Quality results drowned in fragmented articles and blogs.

This repository is dedicated to **maintaining "Negentropy" in these three directions**: collecting, cleaning, and structuring them.

## 🏗️ The Three Pillars

### 🗡️ Pillar I: Tools (Praxis)
> **Entropy reduction at the physical layer. We don't reinvent the wheel; we make it spin more precisely.**

| Project                                                | Description                                                  | Status   |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| **[Burp-Negentropy-Extension](Tools/Burp-Extension/)** | **Traffic Negentropy**. Burp plugin providing Copy Lite (de-noising) and batch interaction fixes. | ✅ Stable |
| **[Auto-Recon-Scripts](Tools/Scripts/)**               | *Coming Soon...* Automated asset reconnaissance script collection. | 🚧 Dev    |

---

### 🧠 Pillar II: Methodology (Gnosis)
> **Entropy reduction at the logical layer. Translating human experience into machine-readable Prompts and SOPs.**

| Framework                                       | Description                                                  | Type   |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| **[AI-Security-Prompts](Methodology/Prompts/)** | **Prompt Engineering**. Standardized prompt library for SQLi/XSS analysis to eliminate AI hallucinations. | 📝 Text |
| **[Entropy-SOP](Methodology/Workflows/)**       | **SOPs**. Standardized entropy-reduction workflows from recon to reporting. | 📜 Doc  |

---

### 🔗 Pillar III: Niche Arsenal (Knowledge)
> **Refusing Mediocrity. We do not collect mainstream tools (like SQLMap), but only "Hidden Gems" and "Self-Developed Mods" that solve specific pain points.**

This is the "Special Operations" zone of the Negentropy system. We focus on collecting code snippets that **significantly reduce entropy in specific stages** but are rarely known.

#### 🧪 Self-Developed & Forked
*Code born from "impromptu ideas" in actual combat, becoming the key to solving problems.*

| Tool / Script                                          | Pain Point Solved                                            | Lang |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--- |
| **[Burp-Negentropy-Extension](Tools/Burp-Extension/)** | Solves Burp batch interaction gaps and token waste during AI analysis. | Java |
| **[Example-Script]**                                   | *(Example)* Hard-coded decryption script for a specific OA system version. | Py   |

#### 💎 Hidden Gems
*Open-source projects with low Star counts but miraculous effects in specific scenarios.*

* **[Project-X]** - *(TBD)* Focuses on solving echo issues in a niche WebLogic version.
* **[Tool-Y]** - *(TBD)* Identifies "secondary development" fingerprints ignored by conventional scanners.

#### 📑 Deep Dive Resources
*Only high-quality articles with "unique insights" or "reproducibility", rejecting fluff.*

* **[Article-Z]** - *(TBD)* Practices on Prompt tuning for logic vulnerability mining.
